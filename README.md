 ```
-  This will provide all the routes to your app and all the components.

    <RouterProvider router={router}>
      <App />
    </RouterProvider>
 ```
---

```
- This will provide the error that was thrown
  const error = useRouteError()
  console.log('ðŸ˜‡ L-6 in error-page.jsx=> ', error.data)
```
---

```
- This will provide the Contact component in the root component as  a child and we can see 2 component and more on the same page.

- But we need to use <Outlet> to tell where to render our other component

 {
    path: '/',
    element: <Root />,
    errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'contacts/:contactId',
        element: <Contact />,
      },
    ],
  }

  <div>
  <Outlet>
  </div>
```

```
- Client side routing without using <a href='' ></a> instead use <Link to={}></Link>
```
---

```
- useLoaderData,  loader as rootLoader  helps us to pass the data to the route
```
---

```
-  <Form> prevents the browser from sending the request to the server and sends it to your route action instead. 

- all of your useLoaderData hooks update and the UI stays in sync with your data automatically.

          <Form method='post'>
            <button type='submit'>New</button>
          </Form>       
```
---

```
- loader is a function that we pass to the place whwere we are creating the routed so now whenever the route gets changed this loader function will get the url and will call the function that is defined in loader and useLoaderData will use the data fetched loader function and will keep our page sync without using useEffect 

 loader: contactLoader,
