- This will provide the Contact component in the root component as  a child and we can see 2 component and more on the same page.

- But we need to use <Outlet> to tell where to render our other component

 {
    path: '/',
    element: <Root />,
    errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'contacts/:contactId',
        element: <Contact />,
      },
    ],
  }

  <div>
  <Outlet>
  </div>

```
